# Todoist
A simple and responsive todo list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The design is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes using media queries. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI/UX principles without any frameworks.
